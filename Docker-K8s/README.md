# üê≥ Docker & Kubernetes Projects üö¢

This repository contains various projects, examples, and configuration files showcasing my skills in **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes (k8s)** for orchestration. These resources are designed to be accessible to those learning the ropes while demonstrating key concepts and my ability to work with production-ready patterns.

## üöÄ What You'll Find Here

* **Dockerfiles:** Simple, multi-stage, and optimized `Dockerfiles` for various applications (e.g., Node.js, Python, static HTML).
* **Docker Compose:** Examples using `docker-compose.yml` for running multi-container applications locally (e.g., a web app with a separate database).
* **Kubernetes Manifests:**
    * **Deployments:** Demonstrations of desired state management and rolling updates.
    * **Services:** Examples of ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services for application exposure.
    * **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Methods for separating configuration from application code.
* **Basic CI/CD Patterns:** Scripts or notes on how these containers are built and pushed to a registry.

## üí° Get Started (For Newbies)

1.  **Start with Docker:** Look at the simple Dockerfile examples first to understand the build process.
2.  **Move to Docker Compose:** Run a local application stack to see how multiple containers interact.
3.  **Explore k8s:** Check out the basic Deployment and Service YAML files to grasp the core resource types.

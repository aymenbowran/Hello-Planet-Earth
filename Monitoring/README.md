# 👁️ Monitoring & Observability Configurations 📊

This repository holds configurations, dashboards, and scripts used to implement comprehensive monitoring solutions. A key part of site reliability is knowing **what's happening** and **when things break**, and this section showcases my experience with essential observability tools.

## 🔍 Tools and Components

* **Prometheus:** Configuration files (`prometheus.yml`) for scraping metrics from various targets.
* **Grafana:** JSON dashboard exports to visualize key application and infrastructure metrics.
* **Alertmanager:** Configuration for routing, grouping, and silencing alerts.
* **Exporters:** Examples of using common Prometheus Exporters (e.g., `node_exporter`, `cAdvisor`) to gather host and container metrics.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Illustrated

* **Service Discovery:** How targets are automatically discovered and added to the monitoring system.
* **Metric Visualization:** Creating effective, readable dashboards that tell a story about system health.
* **Alerting Rules:** Defining thresholds and conditions that trigger notifications when performance is degraded.
* **The Four Golden Signals:** Demonstrating monitoring for **Latency**, **Traffic**, **Errors**, and **Saturation** in specific application examples.

## 📘 Beginner's Insight

Monitoring isn't just about collecting data; it's about **converting data into action**. The goal is to set up systems so they can proactively warn you about problems before users are affected. Pay attention to how the alerting rules connect to the dashboards.

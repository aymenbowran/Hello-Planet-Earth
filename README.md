# üöÄ DevOps & Cloud Engineering Portfolio

üëã Hello! I'm glad you're here. This repository serves as somewhat of a portfolio or if you're just trying to learn, a living collection of **IaC**, **container orchestration**, **monitoring configurations**, and **automation scripts**.

---

## üéØ What You Will Find Here

This portfolio is divided into four key domains of Cloud and DevOps engineering, each with its own detailed `README.md` that explains the contents and purpose:

| Directory | Core Focus | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`docker-k8s`** | **Containerization & Orchestration** | Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (k8s) Manifests |
| **`monitoring`** | **Observability & Alerting** | Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Exporters |
| **`scripts`** | **Automation & Utility** | Bash Scripting, Python Utilities, CI/CD Helpers |
| **`terraform`** | **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | HashiCorp Terraform (for AWS/Azure/GCP resources) |

## ‚ú® Core Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio collectively highlights my proficiency in the following areas:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing infrastructure lifecycle through code for consistency and repeatability.
2.  **Cloud-Native Architecture:** Building, deploying, and managing applications using containers and microservices.
3.  **Automation:** Eliminating manual tasks through effective shell and high-level scripting.
4.  **System Reliability:** Implementing robust monitoring and alerting for quick incident response and proactive health checks.
5.  **GitOps & Version Control:** Managing all configuration and code changes via a standard version control workflow.

## üí° How to Navigate This Portfolio (Newbie Guide)

This repository is structured to be **newbie-friendly**, with clear explanations of *why* specific tools or patterns were chosen.

* **To See Infrastructure:** Head into the **`terraform`** directory to see how cloud resources are defined.
* **To See Application Deployment:** Check out the **`docker-k8s`** folder for application definitions and orchestration logic.
* **To See Reliability:** Examine the **`monitoring`** configurations to understand how health and performance are measured.
* **To See Automation:** Look through the **`scripts`** directory for examples of everyday efficiency gains.

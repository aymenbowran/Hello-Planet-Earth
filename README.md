# üöÄ DevOps & Cloud Engineering QoL

üëã Hello! I'm glad you're here. This repository serves as somewhat of a portfolio or if you're just trying to learn, a living collection of **IaC**, **container orchestration**, **monitoring configurations**, and **automation scripts**.

## üéØ What You Will Find Here

This "project" is divided into four key domains of Cloud and DevOps engineering, each with its own detailed `README.md` that explains the contents and purpose:

| Directory | Core Focus | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`docker-k8s`** | **Containerization & Orchestration** | Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (k8s) Manifests |
| **`monitoring`** | **Observability & Alerting** | Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Exporters |
| **`scripts`** | **Automation & Utility** | Bash Scripting, Python Utilities, CI/CD Helpers |
| **`terraform`** | **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | HashiCorp Terraform (for AWS/Azure/GCP resources) |

## üí° How to Navigate This Portfolio (Newbie Guide)

This repository is structured to be **newbie-friendly**, with clear explanations of *why* specific tools or patterns were chosen.

* **To See Infrastructure:** Head into the **`terraform`** directory to see how cloud resources are defined.
* **To See Application Deployment:** Check out the **`docker-k8s`** folder for application definitions and orchestration logic.
* **To See Reliability:** Examine the **`monitoring`** configurations to understand how health and performance are measured.
* **To See Automation:** Look through the **`scripts`** directory for examples of everyday efficiency gains.

This repository is ALWAYS under development, there's never not something to automate. Give me some time. While the structure is complete, some directories may temporarily appear empty as I continue to upload and refine the associated code and configuration files.
